# Lucid Contributions

First of all, thank you for contributing. Itâ€™s appreciated.

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Make a GitHub issue before doing any significant amount of work. Make sure the core team thinks your idea makes sense for the project. This step is really important. If you skip this, your PR will likely be rejected.
3. Run `npm test` to lint and test. Don't commit before fixing all errors and warnings.
4. Reference the issue's number in your commit. E.g.: "Did this #12"
5. Make a pull request.

## Process

- All PRs should at minimum have a label [semver-major/minor/patch/none]. This helps identify what kind of version bump the PR represents.
- Branches should follow this convention (where 1234 is either a GitHub PR or an ANXR ticket):
  - feature/1234-added-something
  - quality/1234-refactored-something
  - bugfix/1234-fixed-something
  - release/2.0.0

## Component structure

Some of these conventions can be checked against a component by running the `common` tests. Here's an example of how to do that:

```javascript
import { common } from '../../util/generic-tests';

import MyNewComponent from './MyNewComponent';

describe('MyNewComponent', () => {
	common(MyNewComponent);

	// Other tests...
});
```

- Use `isX` or `hasX` props for boolean types even when it differs from native.
- Make sure all components allow `className` and `style` to be extended for consumer convenience.
- Use `onX` props for all event handlers.
  - Use `onVerbNoun` structure.
- Use `handleX` methods for event handlers.
- Handlers that are passing through to native handlers should include the `event` as the last argument.
- If the component is a thin wrapper around a native control, be sure to pass through any extra props through to the native component.
- Stateless by default, uses the reducer pattern for stateful components. Don't use `setState` anywhere in our components.
- Prefer `span`s for root level component elements.

## Styling

- Css classes used for state, such as `.is-active`, should also be prefixed with the component name. E.g. Button should use the class `lucid-Button-is-active`.
- We have a naming convention for our props. Below is a list of examples that are valid. Please see the `variables.less` file for real world examples.

```
@type-propName
@type-subType-propName

@ComponentName-type-propName
@ComponentName-type-subType-propName
```

## Code styling

- We are `createClass` only, no ES6 classes.
- Folders should use kebab case e.g. "this-is-a-folder/and-a-javascript-file.js".
- Components should use start case e.g.:
  - "MyComponent"
  - "AnotherComponentHere.jsx"

## Tests

- Components should have a `Component.spec.jsx` that lives alongside the component jsx file.
- Most tests should be shallow rendered using `enzyme`.
- If your tests need to be functional, i.e. using button clicks, then be sure to use the `describeWithDOM` util.
